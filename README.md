# E2iPlayer for E2

This is a fork of original @samsamsam E2iPlayer.
It's not a copy of PRIVATE version, that I haven't got!!
I have made some changes to italian section of plugin, that I'm interesting in.

If master project reopens, I will send merge request to original one.
Anyway, thank you @samsamsam for your huge work!

If you want to try my changes, simply copy the files in IPTVPlayer folder 
in box folder '/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/IPTVPlayer'
and reboot enigma2 (rebooting only GUI is enough).

Don't copy files, before regular installation of plugin from plugin menu or ipk.
It's recommended to make a backup copy of folder.
